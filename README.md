# Rkss.nvim
Rwyphn's Neovim configuration using hotpot and fennel.
## About
I gave up viml with complex syntax, not to mention the introduction of vim9, it is better to go directly to neovim. 

I don't like the syntax of lua, so wrote the configuration with fennel. 

Functional programming languages delight me.

Ringed knight straight sword is my favourite weapon in DarksoulsIII, so named my config like this.
## Usage
```
brew install neovim ripgrep fd && git clone https://github.com/rwyphn/rkss.nvim ~/.config/nvim/
```
Now run it.
