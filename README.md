# Rkss.nvim Neovim configuration using hotpot and fennel.
    I gave up viml with complex syntax, not to mention the introduction of vim9, it is better to go directly to neovim. I don't like the syntax of lua, so I wrote the configuration with fennel. Functional programming languages delight me.
# Usage
```
brew install neovim ripgrep fd && git clone https://github.com/rwyphn/rkss.nvim ~/.config/nvim/
```
Now run it.
